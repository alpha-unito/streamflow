QueueManagerConnector
=====================

The ``QueueManagerConnector`` is an abstract connector that serves as a base class to implement High Performance Computing connectors, based on queue managers (e.g., :ref:`Slurm <SlurmConnector>`, :ref:`PBS <PBSConnector>`, and :ref:`Flux <FluxConnector>`). It extends the :ref:`ConnectorWrapper <ConnectorWrapper>` interface, allowing users to offload jobs to local or remote queue managers. Plus, it extends the :ref:`BatchConnector <BatchConnector>` interface. The underlying HPC facility is supposed to be constantly active, reducing the deployment phase to deploy the inner connector (e.g., to create an :ref:`SSHConnection <SSHConnection>` pointing to an HPC login node).

.. warning::

   Note that in StreamFlow ``v0.1``, the ``QueueManagerConnector`` directly inherited from the :ref:`SSHConnector <SSHConnector>` at the implementation level. Consequently, all the properties needed to open an SSH connection to the HPC login node (e.g., ``hostname``, ``username``, and ``sshKey``) were defined directly in the ``QueueManagerConnector``. This path is still supported by StreamFlow ``v0.2``, but it is deprecated and will be removed in StreamFlow ``v0.3``.
